# Password Generator

This is my simple password generator website. 

Here is the link to the deployed site:

[github.io](https://spencer-alan.github.io/password-generator/)

I have written all the javascript for this project and had the html and css given to me from my bootcamp class. There are two JavaScript files in this repo. script.js is the actually homework file and the trial.js file is where I have been trying to get the code to work better without making the ctually file super messy.
